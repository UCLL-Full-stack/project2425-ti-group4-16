# Project description

Title: Evently 

Description: With the app Evently, we want users to be able to browse the upcoming events 
by category, location, and date and register for their favorites. Users can create accounts to 
manage their bookings and receive event updates. 
The events can be created and managed by the admin. They can modify the event 
information such as date, place and price, and keep track on the attendees and the revenue 
for each event.
